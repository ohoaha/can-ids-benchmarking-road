# Comparative Evaluation of Anomaly-Based Controller Area Network IDS (Using ROAD CAN Intrusion dataset)

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with the code for our paper on comparative evaluation of CAN IDS with the [ROAD CAN intrusion dataset](https://0xsam.com/road/).

Code for data preprocessing has been used from [pmoriano/can-time-based-ids-benchmark](https://github.com/pmoriano/can-time-based-ids-benchmark).

This repository does not include the dataset. Please download and unzip the ROAD dataset in a new subdirectory called ```road``` in this directory before running the Notebooks.
